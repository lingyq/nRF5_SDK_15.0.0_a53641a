# Loopback

## Requirements

- One board with the serial example running

## Instructions

After building and programming the serial example, connect to the device with the interactive console:


    $ python interactive_pyaci.py -d /dev/ttyACM0 --no-logfile

        To control your device use d[x], type d[x]. and hit tab to see the available methods.
        x is for the device index; devices will be indexed based on the order of com ports
        given with the option -d(the first device, d[0], can also be accessed using device).

We'll send an `Echo` command to test that the device is connected. First, let us read some information
about the command:

    In [1]: cmd.Echo?
    Init signature: cmd.Echo(data)
    Docstring:
    A simple loopback test command, to verify that the serial transport layer is working as
    intended.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
        data : uint8_t[254]
            Data to echo back.
    File:           nrf5_sdk_for_mesh/scripts/interactive_pyaci/aci/aci_cmd.py
    Type:           type


Now we test the command:

    In [2]: send(cmd.Echo("hello world"))
    2017-08-02 10:06:29,338 - INFO - ttyACM0: {event: DeviceEchoRsp, data: {'data': bytearray(b'hello world')}}


The `send` function is a helper function for sending commands to the first connected device. It accepts a
`CommandPacket` object as a parameter. All of these are imported from `aci/aci_cmd.py` by the
interactive script.

To talk to a particular device, you address the device through the list of devices `d`. To send an Echo command
to the first device, we use `d[0]`:

    In [3]: d[0].send(cmd.Echo("hello world"))
    2017-08-02 10:10:29,338 - INFO - ttyACM0: {event: DeviceEchoRsp, data: {'data': bytearray(b'hello world')}}

## Troubleshooting

You might experience the following error:

    2017-08-02 10:13:45,427 - INFO - ttyACM0: cmd Echo, timeout waiting for event

In that case, you should ensure that you're connected to the correct board and verify that the example is
running. You can also try resetting and/or reconnecting the board.

Using a serial terminal emulator, you can try to send an Echo command raw:

    06 02 48 65 6c 6c 6f

You should receive:

    06 82 48 65 6c 6c 6f
